    Extracts peak parameters from the periodic spectrum obtained via IRASA.

    This function identifies and extracts peak parameters such as center frequency (cf), bandwidth (bw),
    and peak height (pw) from a periodic spectrum using scipy's find_peaks function.
    The spectrum can be optionally smoothed prior peak detection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    periodic_spectrum : np.ndarray
        1D or 2D array containing power values of the periodic spectrum (shape: [Channels, Frequencies]
        or [Frequencies]).
    freqs : np.ndarray
        1D array containing frequency values corresponding to the periodic spectrum.
    ch_names : Iterable or None, optional
        List of channel names corresponding to the periodic spectrum. If None, channels are labeled numerically.
        Default is None.
    smooth : bool, optional
        Whether to smooth the spectrum before peak extraction. Smoothing can help in reducing noise and
        better identifying peaks. Default is True.
    smoothing_window : int or float, optional
        The size of the smoothing window in Hz, passed to the Savitzky-Golay filter. Default is 1 Hz.
    cut_spectrum : tuple of (float, float) or None, optional
        Tuple specifying the frequency range (lower_bound, upper_bound) to which the spectrum should be cut
        before peak extraction. If None, peaks are detected across the full frequency range. Default is None.
    peak_threshold : float, optional
        Relative threshold for detecting peaks, defined as a multiple of the standard deviation of the
        filtered spectrum. Default is 1.0.
    min_peak_height : float, optional
        The minimum peak height (in absolute units of the power spectrum) required for a peak to be recognized.
        This can be useful for filtering out noise or insignificant peaks, especially when a "knee" is present
        in the original data, which may persist in the periodic spectrum. Default is 0.01.
    min_peak_distance_hz : float, optional
        The minimum distance between two peaks in Hz to avoid fitting too many peaks in close proximity.
    peak_width_limits : tuple of (float, float), optional
        The lower and upper bounds for peak widths, in Hz. This helps in constraining the peak detection to
        meaningful features. Default is (0.5, 12.0).

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the detected peak parameters for each channel. The DataFrame includes the
        following columns:
        - 'ch_name': Channel name
        - 'cf': Center frequency of the peak
        - 'bw': Bandwidth of the peak
        - 'pw': Peak height (power)


    Notes
    -----
    The function works by first optionally smoothing the periodic spectrum using a Savitzky-Golay filter.
    Then, it performs peak detection using the `scipy.signal.find_peaks` function, taking into account the
    specified peak thresholds and width limits. Peaks that do not meet the minimum height requirement are
    filtered out.

    The `cut_spectrum` parameter can be used to focus peak detection on a specific frequency range, which is
    particularly useful when the region of interest is known in advance.

    center frequency (cf), bandwidth (bw), and peak height (pw) for each time point. It applies smoothing,
    peak detection, and thresholding according to user-defined parameters
    (see get_peak_params for additional Information).

    Parameters
    ----------
    periodic_spectrum : np.ndarray
        2 or 3D array containing power values of the periodic spectrogram (shape: [Channels, Frequencies, Time Points]).

        1D array containing frequency values corresponding to the periodic spectrogram.
    times : np.ndarray
        1D array containing time points corresponding to the periodic spectrogram.
    ch_names : Iterable or None, optional
        List of channel names corresponding to the periodic spectrogram. If None, channels are labeled numerically.
        Default is None.
    smooth : bool, optional
        Whether to smooth the spectrum before peak extraction. Smoothing can help in reducing noise and better
        identifying peaks. Default is True.
    smoothing_window : int or float, optional
        The size of the smoothing window in Hz, passed to the Savitzky-Golay filter. Default is 2 Hz.
    polyorder : int, optional
        The polynomial order for the Savitzky-Golay filter used in smoothing. The polynomial order must be less
        than the window length. Default is 1.
    cut_spectrum : tuple of (float, float) or None, optional
        Tuple specifying the frequency range (lower_bound, upper_bound) to which the spectrum should be cut before
        peak extraction. If None, the full frequency range is used. Default is (1, 40).
    peak_threshold : int or float, optional
        Relative threshold for detecting peaks, defined as a multiple of the standard deviation of the filtered
        spectrum. Default is 1.
    min_peak_height : float, optional
        The minimum peak height (in absolute units of the power spectrum) required for a peak to be recognized.
        This can be useful for filtering out noise or insignificant peaks, especially when a "knee" is present
        in the data. Default is 0.01.
    min_peak_distance_hz : float, optional
        The minimum distance between two peaks in Hz to avoid fitting too many peaks in close proximity.
    peak_width_limits : tuple of (float, float), optional
        The lower and upper bounds for peak widths, in Hz. This helps in constraining the peak detection to
        meaningful features. Default is (0.5, 12).

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the detected peak parameters for each channel and time point. The DataFrame
        includes the following columns:
        - 'ch_name': Channel name
        - 'cf': Center frequency of the peak
        - 'bw': Bandwidth of the peak
        - 'pw': Peak height (power)
        - 'time': Corresponding time point for the peak

    Notes
    -----
    This function iteratively processes each time point in the spectrogram, applying the `get_peak_params`
    function to extract peak parameters at each time point. The resulting peak parameters are combined into
    a single DataFrame.

    The function is particularly useful for analyzing time-varying spectral features, such as in dynamic or
    non-stationary M/EEG data, where peaks may shift in frequency, bandwidth, or amplitude over time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df_peaks : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing peak parameters obtained from the `get_peak_params` function.
